### Supplementary Figure 1: Years foreign-born individuals have been in the Understanding Society survey

### Supplementary Table 1: Descriptive characteristics of the survey participants



![imputation_freq](/figs/imputation_freq.png)
### Supplementary Table 2: Frequency of imputation outcomes
The first two columns represent the number of occupational states present within the sequences before and after imputation. The final column gives the frequency with which these outcomes occurred. Only sequences containing at least one imputes value are included in these results.

### Supplementary Table 3: Comparison of the number of individuals with different sequence lengths before and after data imputation
Each column represents the number of individuals in the sample with the stated number of occupational states before and after imputation. All sequences are included in these results.

### Supplementary Figure 4: Representative occupational trajectories of foreign-born workers only
These trajectories were obtained by applying sequence analysis to foreign-born participants only.
